# Field Tester

Adds an option to Edit Field for creating a template and page to test the field. This can be useful when debugging a field or inputfield.

The added template consists of only the field in question (plus the "Title" field) and the page is added as a child of the Home page with a status of "hidden".

If the test template and page already exist then a link to the testing page and an option to permanently delete the testing template and page are added instead.
